<!--<h3>PhD position in robot learning from demonstration (deadline: Jan 31, 2020)</h3>

<p>The Robot Learning & Interaction Group at the Idiap Research Institute in Switzerland has an open PhD position within the CODIMAN project (cobotics, digital skills and the re-humanization of the workplace), in collaboration with the Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH). The research will be supervised by Dr Sylvain Calinon in the Robot Learning & Interaction group at Idiap, and will be achieved in tight collaboration with Prof. Sarah Dégallier Rochat at the Human-Centered Engineering Institute (HuCE) of BFH.</p>

<p>The CODIMAN project will develop cobotic solutions to allow for true human-robot collaboration in industrial settings. We will examine how to support the implementation and acceptance of new technologies in partial automation and human-machine interactions. The project will address questions such as: what kind of interfaces are needed to facilitate intuitive machine operation and flexible reprogramming?, how to transfer complex manipulation skills by imitation?, which continuous education is needed to prepare workers for cobotics and improve productivity?, and how to foster social acceptance and promote a successful integration?</p>

<p>Besides generating guidelines, the project will also deliver a platform for intuitive human-machine interaction that will provide a basis to acquire the necessary skills. To achieve these goals, the project is interdisciplinary, combining expertise in robotics and social sciences, by working together and in close interaction with the workers. Our industrial partners will let us build technological solutions that are centered on the workers' needs. The detailed research aspects of CODIMAN investigated at Idiap are described below.</p>

<p><b>Research aspects of CODIMAN investigated at Idiap</b></p>

<p>In CODIMAN, we plan to rely on the expertise available at Idiap and BFH in learning from demonstration and movement primitives representations. We will:
<ul><li>extend the concept of movement primitives to a broader range of primitives including time-independent behaviors, such as force, impedance, reactive behaviors, loops in manipulation (repeating a subtask until a signal is detected), collaborative work (anticipation of the robot, waiting for the user, taking user attention into account), and exploration behaviors (ergodic control, imitating search patterns).</li> 
<li>consider the organization of movement primitives not only in series but also in parallel, by treating this organization either as a fusion problem or as a task prioritization problem. This will be exploited to allow the end-users to organize the demonstrations in a hierarchical manner. For example, by first showing the path that a robot should follow, and then showing the required dynamics/speed along this path, while the motion of the robot is constrained by the path (sometimes called​ virtual fixtures or virtual guiding paths).</li>
<li>exploit techniques and implementations related to dynamical systems and hidden Markov models (HMM) to encode sequences of movement primitives. In this model, some parts will be explicitly
parameterized based on our user studies, while some other parts will be learned. The goal is to start from a dictionary of existing movement primitives, with the user demonstrating a complex task
composed of these different primitives, but whose organization is not known in advance. The organization of skills could first be estimated from demonstration, by providing the user with a
representation showing the high-level organization of primitive that has been detected. In case there are several most-likely organizations, an interface could be used to request the user to select the desired option. In case a primitive is missing, the same interface could ask the user if a new primitive should be added to the dictionary.</li>
<li>regenerate sequences of movement primitives, with a visualization on the interface of the ongoing step in the process, and an automatic adaptation to the new situation. This could be achieved by exploiting task-parameterized models that encode signals in multiple coordinate systems, allowing the autonomous adaptation to new location of objects or tools in the robot workspace.</li>
<li>investigate which functionalities should be employed in the three proposed case studies, by assessing their advantages, drawbacks and robustness, and by analyzing the user acceptance and time required to learn these techniques.</li> 
<li>employ for the case studies a transportable robot setup already available at Idiap (7-axis Panda robots from the Franka Emika company).</li></ul>
</p>

<p><b>PhD position at Idiap/EPFL</b></p>

<p>The selected PhD candidate should hold a Master degree in engineering, computer science, physics or applied mathematics, with a background in linear algebra, signal processing, programming, control and/or machine learning. The PhD position is for 4 years, provided successful progress, and should lead to a dissertation. The selected candidate will become a doctoral student at EPFL (after hiring, s/he will submit his/her application to the Doctoral School at EPFL). Annual gross salary ranges from 47,000 CHF (first year) to 50,000 CHF (last year).</p>

<!--<p>These positions will remain open until they have been filled, <b>ideally early 2019</b>. The webpage will be updated once the positions have been filled.</p>-->

<p>The research in the <a href='http://idiap.ch/rli/' target='_blank'>Robot Learning & Interaction Group</a> spans several disciplines at the crossroad of machine learning, optimization, optimal control, geometry, human motion sciences and user interfaces. This <a href='papers/SylvainCalinon-researchStatement.pdf' target='_blank'>research statement</a> provides an overview of our research lines. Our group is small, which facilitates both the collaboration within the group and the visibility of each person's research. We are particularly interested in the challenge of learning/transferring skills from fewer demonstrations or exploration trials than what is currently required.</p>

<h3>Who do I seek?</h3>

<p>Our research activities span several branches of science, and there is consequently no specific educational background sought for these positions. The ideal candidate should have strong expertise in one or a subset of the research topics described above. Other areas of research extending our current lines of research are also welcome for outstanding candidates: if you are a great candidate, I will adapt the project to you!</p>

<p>The ideal candidate is enthusiastic, creative, curious and motivated to do research with both theory and practice. I expect strong mathematical skills (in particular, in linear algebra, machine learning or optimization) and strong coding skills (Python, C++ or Matlab/Octave).</p>

<p>It is important that you take the time to prepare a cover letter (max 2 pages) to explain how your background fit with our research activities (see the <a href='http://calinon.ch/research.htm' target='_blank'>short description of our research</a>, this <a href='papers/SylvainCalinon-researchStatement.pdf' target='_blank'>research statement</a>, and <a href='http://calinon.ch/publications.htm' target='_blank'>our latest publications</a>). As we receive many applications when a postion is opened (usually over a hundred for each open position), a good cover letter can be decisive to be shortlisted!</p>

<p>When preparing your CV, do not assume I know everything you know! In particular, for PhD positions, I might not be aware of your university rankings or grading systems. When available, relative ranking will then be much more informative, such as average grade or ranks in the class. In some cases, I may otherwise not necessarily be able to gauge how good you are from your grades or your university. If you are applying for a PhD position, you may not have experience with research, but you will most likely have done projects during courses, so tell me about the projects you liked the most!</p> 

<!--<h3>How to apply?</h3>

<p>Interested candidates should submit a CV, a cover letter, transcripts of grades (for PhD positions only), and the names of three references (or recommendation letters) through the Idiap online recruitment system: <a href='http://www.idiap.ch/webapps/jobs/ors/applicant/position/index.php?PHP_APE_DR_9e581720b5ef40dc7af21c41bac4f4eb=%7B__TO%3D%27detail%27%3B__PK%3D%2710253%27%7D' target='_blank'>link to PhD positions</a>, <a href='http://www.idiap.ch/webapps/jobs/ors/applicant/position/index.php?PHP_APE_DR_9e581720b5ef40dc7af21c41bac4f4eb=%7B__TO%3D%27detail%27%3B__PK%3D%2710254%27%7D' target='_blank'>link to Postdoc position</a>.</p>-->
